# __SlurpCraft Modpack__

## Information
This modpack is for the SlurpSquad server. It features various adventure mods such as biomes o plenty, and things to make `vanilla` minecraft much more difficult. While it is not really considered a "Vanilla+" modpack, it is considered qutie a difficult mod to get starting off with very little to do with tech.

## Features
Among various quality of life improvements, this modpack also includes various adventure mods such as `Biomes O Plenty`, `Dungeons Plus`, `Darker Depths`, `The Twilight Forest`, and `Valhelsia Core`. 

It also includes various beauty improvements such as `Falling Leaves`, `Atmospheric`, and `Botania`.

This modpack is very much not a quest-based mod pack. It is more of an extension of what Vanilla Minecraft originally was. You create your own adventures, buildings, and work toward a goal on your own.

While this modpack is originally created for the `Slurp Squad` server, it can still be adapted for single player and multiplayer with your own friends.
